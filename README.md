Rate Your Renter Application.  For Liftoff project with LaunchCode

## Overview

The Rate-Your-Renter app will allow staff of condominiums and apartmemt complexes to rate their renters.  Renters will receive a starred rating, and rating for their ability to pay rent on time.  The main purpose of the app is to help keep track of bad renters to save a condiminium, or apartmenet complex from losing money on renters who destroy their property, or who consistently fail to pay rent.


## Features

User Story 1 Account: The user will be able to register/create a new account.  The user will be able to log in to their account.  There will be different permissions.  Some users will be able to create and delete profiles.  Most will only be able to add ratings, and click on "buttons".

User Story 2 Profile: The user will be able to create and abolish profiles for renters.

User Story 3 Rate: The user will be able to give a starred rating on profiles.

User Story 4 Calculate: The app will calculate the average of the given ratings for a renter's profile. An average will not be displayed on a profile until at least three months-worth of ratings are available to calculate (2 or less may cause an unfair/baised rating).
